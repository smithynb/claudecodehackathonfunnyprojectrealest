# Grow a Garden Terminal game with OpenTUI

The first computer for many kids these days is their iPad and they play Roblox games like Grow a Garden. So to keep them tech literate, let's teach them the terminal and vim motions.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.3. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
